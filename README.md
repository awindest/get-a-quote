This little snippet of code grabs random quotes from Luke Peavey's excellent https://api.quotable.io/random endpoint.

Unfortunately as of December 2025, the SSL Certificate for this site has expired and modern web browsers won't connect and you get a NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID error. 

You could download this code and

```pnmp i```

```pnpm run dev```

This will run it locally and you can enjoy some nice quotes.
